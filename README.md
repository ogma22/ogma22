Hi! I'm ogma22 (Diana GarcÃ­a) ðŸ‘‹

I am starting to build my portfolio as a data scientist, although I am a junior in this field. I bring senior-level experience in project management, with 15 years of expertise. Additionally, I hold a Master's degree in project management and am PMP certified. As an electronic engineer, I am well-equipped with technical skills that complement my data science knowledge.
